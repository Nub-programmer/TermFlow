TERMflow – FINAL STABILITY FIX + FLOW MODE INTERFACE + WEBSITE GENERATION

READ CAREFULLY. FOLLOW EXACTLY.
THIS IS A REPAIR + EXTENSION TASK, NOT A REWRITE.

Everything that currently works MUST continue to work.
If there is a choice between clever and safe — choose SAFE.

════════════════════════════
PART 1 — HARD FIX: `h` AND `i`
════════════════════════════

Problem:
Pressing `h` or `i` causes layout corruption, blue/black squares, or UI breakage.

MANDATORY FIX (DO NOT PATCH — RECREATE):

1. DELETE all existing implementations of:
   - `h` key handler
   - `i` key handler
   - Any Help / Info widget, panel, container, or placeholder
   - Any layout slot reserved for them

After deletion:
Pressing `h` or `i` should do NOTHING.

2. RE-IMPLEMENT Help (`h`) and Info (`i`) CLEANLY with these rules:

Help (`h`) and Info (`i`) MUST be:
- Floating overlays (absolute / modal layer)
- NOT part of the main layout tree
- NOT inside grid / flex / panels
- NOT reserving width or height
- NOT affecting Flow Mode layout

Behavior:
- Press `h` → Help overlay opens
- Press `i` → Info overlay opens
- Only ONE overlay can exist at a time
- Press `ESC` → closes overlay
- Underlying UI resumes unchanged

NO background blocks
NO placeholder rectangles
NO blue or black squares

────────────────
HELP CONTENT (TEXT ONLY)
────────────────
Help MUST explicitly list:

GENERAL
- :  Open Command Palette
- ESC  Back / Close
- f  Toggle Flow Mode
- Enter  Add task
- Space  Toggle task
- Del  Remove task

FLOW MODE
- Single-task focus (read-only)
- Pomodoro auto-start
- Task auto-advance on completion

FLOW MODE INTERFACE SETTINGS
- Pomodoro ON / OFF
- Reflection ON / OFF
- Focus Buddy ON / OFF
- Focus Buddy Motion ON / OFF
- Focus Buddy Position:
  • Left
  • Right
  • Inline
- Buddy Animation Mode:
  • Idle only
  • Idle + Active Motion

Help is DISCOVERY.
No buttons. No interactivity.

────────────────
INFO CONTENT
────────────────
Info overlay shows:
- TermFlow
- “A terminal-first deep focus system”
- Author: Atharv
- Community: AxonInnova (https://dsc.gg/axoninnova)

════════════════════════════
PART 2 — FLOW MODE INTERFACE (SAFE IMPLEMENTATION)
════════════════════════════

Do NOT redesign Flow Mode.
Do NOT change layout proportions.

Ensure Flow Mode:
- Shows ONE task at a time
- Task list is read-only
- On completion → next task auto-loads
- Pomodoro panel is COMPACT (no oversized rectangle)
- Buttons are inline and minimal
- Reflection panel is optional (toggle-controlled)

Flow Mode Interface controls:
- Must NOT break Command Palette
- If palette discovery is unstable, rely on HELP as the source of truth
- Toggles must apply instantly
- Settings persist across sessions

════════════════════════════
PART 3 — COMMAND PALETTE STABILITY
════════════════════════════

Fix palette so it:
- Never goes empty
- Never loses focus
- Resets search on close
- Closes automatically when Help or Info opens
- ESC always exits safely

DO NOT remove any existing commands.

════════════════════════════
PART 4 — WEBSITE GENERATION (WebFolder)
════════════════════════════

Inside the folder named EXACTLY:
WebFolder/

Create these files:
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js

This is a PROFESSIONAL PRODUCT WEBSITE for TermFlow.
