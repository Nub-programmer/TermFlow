Context:
This is a Python TUI app built using the Textual framework. Be careful not to break existing functionality. Make minimal, safe changes only where requested.

1️⃣ Default Theme Change

Change the default theme of the application to Atom One Dark instead of the current theme.

If the theme is defined in config defaults, update the default value there.

If the theme is set in code, ensure Atom One Dark is applied at startup.

Users should still be able to override the theme via config later.

2️⃣ Fix Flow Mode Logic Bug

There is a bug in Flow Mode Interface where it shows:

"All tasks completed, add tasks in dashboard"

even when tasks exist and are NOT marked as done.

Fix the logic so that:

The message is shown only when the todo list is empty OR all tasks are completed

If even one task is pending, the message must NOT appear

Ensure the logic checks task completion state correctly, not just task count or cached state

Keep the fix clean and readable.

3️⃣ Website (web folder) – Download Instructions

Edit the website inside the web/ folder to include a clear How to Install & Run TermFlow section.

Add instructions that explain:

Installation
pip install termflow

Run
termflow


Also add a short note like:

“Requires Python 3.8+ and a modern terminal.”

Do not remove existing sections like features—only extend the site cleanly.

4️⃣ Code Comments Style (IMPORTANT)

Rewrite or add comments where you touch code so they:

Do NOT sound AI-generated

Sound like they were written by a teen / student developer

Use casual, Gen-Z-ish phrasing

Examples of comment style:

# this runs on startup so the UI doesn't look dead
# quick check so we don’t show fake “all done” vibes
# fallback just in case config gets messed up
# yeah this looks weird but it fixes a Textual focus bug


Keep comments short, informal, and human.

Final Rules

Do NOT refactor unrelated code

Do NOT rename files unless required

Do NOT add unnecessary features

Prioritize stability over cleverness

Keep changes minimal and production-safe

Make sure the app still runs correctly after changes.
