You previously claimed to implement a Focus Buddy, but NO ASCII character was actually rendered.
This is a regression and must be fixed.

You are now REQUIRED to visibly render a Focus Buddy exactly as described below.
Do NOT claim completion unless the character is physically visible in the UI.

====================================
FOCUS BUDDY — NON-NEGOTIABLE
====================================

The Focus Buddy MUST:

- Be a real ASCII / text-based character
- Be visibly rendered on screen
- Match the minimalist, terminal aesthetic shown in the provided screenshots
- Appear ONLY during Flow Mode
- Never behave like a chatbot
- Never spam messages
- Never animate fast or distractingly

If it is not visible on screen, the task is NOT complete.

====================================
VISUAL DESIGN (MANDATORY)
====================================

Design a calm, neutral ASCII buddy.
NO anime.
NO kawaii.
NO emojis.
NO faces with expressions.

Example style (you may refine but must stay minimal):

Idle:
   [•]

Focused:
   [■]

Resting:
   [·]

OR

   │
   │
   ●

Choose ONE design and keep it consistent.

- Use dim or yellow accent color
- Render it in a dedicated, subtle area (corner or beside intention)
- It must feel like a quiet presence, not a feature

====================================
BEHAVIOR RULES
====================================

- Appears ONLY when Flow Mode is active
- Has exactly THREE possible messages (1–3 words max):
  - "Begin."
  - "Stay."
  - "Done."
- Messages appear briefly, then fade
- No narration, no motivation, no tips

State mapping:
- Flow start → Idle → "Begin."
- Mid-session → Focused → "Stay."
- Flow end → Resting → "Done."

====================================
TOGGLE (REQUIRED)
====================================

Add a keyboard toggle:

- b → toggle Focus Buddy ON/OFF
- Default: OFF
- Persist preference in a local config file (safe JSON)
- Toggle works instantly without restart

This ensures professionalism and user control.

====================================
FLOW MODE VERIFICATION
====================================

Ensure:
- Buddy is NOT rendered outside Flow Mode
- Buddy disappears immediately when ESC exits Flow Mode
- UI remains minimal and uncluttered

====================================
NO LIES RULE
====================================

Do NOT say “implemented” unless:
- ASCII character is visible
- Toggle key works
- Messages appear correctly
- Buddy disappears outside Flow Mode

If any part is missing, explain what is incomplete instead of claiming success.

====================================
AFTER IMPLEMENTATION
====================================

Respond with:
1. ASCII sketch of the Focus Buddy used
2. Where it renders on screen
3. Confirmation that toggle (b) works
4. One sentence explaining why it does NOT break Flow

TermFlow is a mindset tool.
The Focus Buddy must feel like silence, not personality.
