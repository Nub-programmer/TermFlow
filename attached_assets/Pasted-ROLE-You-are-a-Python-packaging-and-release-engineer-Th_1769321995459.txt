ROLE:
You are a Python packaging and release engineer. This project is a Textual TUI app that already works perfectly.

ABSOLUTE RULES (DO NOT VIOLATE):

❌ DO NOT modify UI layout, widgets, focus logic, Flow Mode behavior, CSS, key bindings, or rendering.

❌ DO NOT refactor working logic.

❌ DO NOT “optimize” or “clean up” code that affects runtime behavior.

❌ DO NOT rename internal modules or folders used by imports.

❌ DO NOT touch Textual screens, modals, or event handlers.

If a change risks breaking runtime behavior, SKIP IT.

GOAL

Make this project 100% PyPI-ready while preserving identical runtime behavior.

STEP 1 — SINGLE PACKAGE GUARANTEE (CRITICAL)

There must be exactly ONE importable package named termflow.

The correct package is the folder that contains:

core/

ui/

panels/

utils/

If any duplicate termflow/ folders exist:

Remove or move duplicates outside the package path

Keep ONLY the canonical one

Ensure every folder inside termflow/ has an __init__.py

DO NOT rename termflow

STEP 2 — ENTRY POINT (SAFE)

Ensure startup logic lives in termflow/main.py

If no run() function exists, wrap existing startup code inside:

def run():
    app = TermFlowApp()
    app.run()


DO NOT change how the app launches visually or behaviorally

STEP 3 — pyproject.toml (PACKAGING ONLY)

Create or update pyproject.toml to include:

[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools>=61.0"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "termflow"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A minimalist terminal productivity hub built with Textual"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.9"
dependencies = ["textual"]

[project.scripts]
termflow = "termflow.main:run"


Do NOT add optional features, extras, or dev tools

STEP 4 — FILES TO IGNORE

Ensure these are excluded from the package:

.replit

WebFolder/

.pythonlibs/

__pycache__/

.upm/

.config/

Use MANIFEST.in if needed.

STEP 5 — VALIDATION (MANDATORY)

Before finishing:

Run pip install -e .

Run termflow

Confirm UI, Flow Mode, Pomodoro, Tasks, and Reflection work EXACTLY as before

If anything breaks, STOP and revert

FINAL OUTPUT

Confirm the project is safe to upload with:

python -m build
twine check dist/*


Report only packaging changes made

Do NOT touch UI logic

Proceed carefully and conservatively.
