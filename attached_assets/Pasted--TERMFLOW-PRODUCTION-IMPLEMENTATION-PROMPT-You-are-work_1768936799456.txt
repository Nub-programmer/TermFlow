🔥 TERMFLOW — PRODUCTION IMPLEMENTATION PROMPT

You are working on a serious, production-grade, terminal-first productivity system called TermFlow.

This is NOT a toy todo app.
It must feel intentional, opinionated, calm, and different from every other terminal productivity tool.

CORE PHILOSOPHY

Terminal-native

Keyboard-first

Flow-state oriented (not task dumping)

Minimal UI, maximum clarity

No clutter, no gimmicks

Feels like a mindset tool, not a checklist

REQUIRED FIXES (DO THESE FIRST)
1️⃣ TIME & LOCALE (CRITICAL)

Time must use the user’s local system timezone

❌ No hardcoded timezones

❌ No external APIs

✅ Use Python datetime + zoneinfo or system localtime

Time & date must:

Update live

Always match the system clock

2️⃣ BRAND IDENTITY RESTORATION

Restore the tagline under the ASCII logo:

"your minimalist terminal productivity hub"

Must:

Center-align with the logo

Never disappear on terminal resize

Wrap safely on small terminals

3️⃣ TODO INTERACTION BUG FIX

Fix checkbox toggling:

Space or Enter toggles completion

Selected item ≠ completed item (clear visual distinction)

Keyboard-only interaction (no mouse dependency)

Persist todos safely to todos.json

No UI lag or state desync

4️⃣ QUOTE SYSTEM → REFLECTION SYSTEM

Rename section from QUOTE → Reflection

Remove religious or ideological bias

Use a curated, neutral dataset:

Philosophy

Science

Builders / engineers

Artists

Anonymous reflections

Rotate categories evenly, not randomly biased

Store in reflections.json

🌊 CORE DIFFERENTIATOR — FLOW MODE

FLOW MODE is the soul of TermFlow.

FLOW MODE RULES

User does not manage individual tasks

User enters ONE intention per session

Example: “Study physics” / “Build TermFlow”

Once active:

All non-essential UI disappears

Todos become read-only

Pomodoro auto-starts

ONLY THESE REMAIN VISIBLE

Current intention

Timer

One contextual reflection

Everything else fades out or hides.

FLOW MODE BEHAVIOR

Screen visually darkens except active panel

No notifications

No weather

No extra panels

Calm, distraction-free environment

ESC cleanly exits Flow Mode and restores layout

KEYBINDINGS

f → Enter Flow Mode

esc → Exit Flow Mode

p → Pause / Resume timer

t → Quick-add todo (outside Flow Mode only)

UI POLISH (NO REDESIGN)

Keep existing layout proportions

Improve spacing consistency

Reduce border noise

Highlight ONLY the active panel

Color hierarchy:

Cyan → time

Green → actions

Yellow → context

Dim gray → background text
