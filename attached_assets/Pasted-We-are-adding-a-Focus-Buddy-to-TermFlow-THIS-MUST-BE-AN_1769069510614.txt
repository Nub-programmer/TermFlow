We are adding a Focus Buddy to TermFlow.

THIS MUST BE AN ANIME-STYLE ASCII CHARACTER.
NOT a square.
NOT a dot.
NOT a single glyph.
If the result is minimal or symbolic, the task is FAILED.

==============================
FOCUS BUDDY — VISUAL STYLE
==============================

- The Focus Buddy MUST be a MULTI-LINE ASCII CHARACTER (minimum 12 lines).
- The character MUST look humanoid and anime-inspired:
  - Head
  - Hair
  - Body / posture
- Style reference:
  - Calm anime character
  - Neutral expression
  - Standing or sitting pose
- NO emojis
- NO kaomoji
- NO single-character placeholders

Think: “terminal anime illustration”, not mascot.

You MUST render the full ASCII art in the UI.
If it does not visually resemble a character, redo it.

==============================
LAYOUT & SCREEN PLACEMENT
==============================

The Focus Buddy MUST live in a DEDICATED SIDE PANEL.

Supported layouts (user selectable):
1. LEFT SIDE PANEL (buddy takes ~40–50% width)
2. RIGHT SIDE PANEL (buddy takes ~40–50% width)

This panel:
- Exists ONLY during Flow Mode
- Completely disappears when Flow Mode ends
- Does NOT overlap other panels
- Does NOT push content outside the terminal

==============================
FLOW MODE INTEGRATION
==============================

- Buddy appears ONLY when Flow Mode starts
- Buddy disappears immediately on ESC (exit Flow Mode)
- No ghost panels
- No leftover spacing
- Layout must fully restore

==============================
BUDDY STATES (ANIME POSES)
==============================

Use DIFFERENT ASCII ART for each state:

1. Idle (Flow just started)
2. Focused (Pomodoro running)
3. Rest (Flow finished or paused)

Each state must be a VISUALLY DISTINCT POSE.
Do NOT reuse the same art.

Optional text (MAX 2 words):
- "Begin."
- "Focus."
- "Done."

No other dialogue.

==============================
USER OPTIONS (MANDATORY)
==============================

Add Command Palette options:

- Toggle Focus Buddy ON / OFF
- Choose Buddy Position:
  - Left
  - Right
- (Optional) Choose Buddy Variant if multiple characters exist

Persist these settings safely in config.

==============================
STRICT RULES
==============================

- The buddy is NOT a chatbot
- The buddy does NOT talk repeatedly
- The buddy does NOT animate rapidly
- The buddy does NOT appear outside Flow Mode

If ANY of these are violated, the implementation is wrong.

==============================
DELIVERABLE CHECK
==============================

After implementation, explicitly show:
1. The full ASCII anime character(s)
2. The panel layout behavior
3. The command palette options
4. Confirmation that the buddy fully disappears on Flow exit
